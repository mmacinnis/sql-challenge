Herewith begins the contents of the README.

Since there were few instructions in this regard provided, I will list the files and what they do:
old employee database.sql = code exported from database built using QuickDBD
old employee database.png = picture of the DB from QuickDBD as requested.
queries.sql = code for all requested queries to the DB.
data/ = the CSV files we were provided at the start of the assignment.

This code should meet all requirements listed on the Canvas website for "Challenge 9",
which I won't bother to include here as you are probably looking at them.
